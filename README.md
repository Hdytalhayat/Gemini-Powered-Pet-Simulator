# Gemini Powered Pet Simulator

A prototype 2D top-down pet simulation game in Unity where each NPC has unique personalities, needs, and interactions, powered by Google Gemini AI.

---

## ðŸ“œ About the Project

This project is an implementation of a simulation game where players are tasked with taking care of a group of AI pets. Each pet has different traits (social, lazy, clean) generated by AI, directly affecting their behavior and needs. The game is endless and ends when all pets die.

The main purpose of this repository is to serve as an example of how to integrate Large Language Models (LLM) such as Gemini into Unity games to create dynamic and unpredictable NPC behaviors.

## âœ¨ Key Features

* **AI-Generated Dynamic Personalities**: Each NPC has a name, social level, laziness, and cleanliness generated by Gemini.
* **Needs System**: NPCs have attributes such as hunger, thirst, energy, cleanliness, and happiness that continuously decrease.
* **State Machine-Based AI**: NPCs autonomously decide what actions to take (eat, drink, rest, bathe, play, or wander).
* **NPC Interactions**: Interactions between NPCs are generated by Gemini, with positive or negative outcomes affecting their happiness.
* **Offline Development Mode**: Includes a toggle to run the game without calling the API, useful for development and saving quota.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run this project on your computer, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

* **Unity Hub** and **Unity Editor (Version 2021.3.x or newer)**.
* **Google Gemini API Key**. You can obtain it from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/).

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hdytalhayat/Gemini-Powered-Pet-Simulator.git
   ```
2. **Open the project in Unity Hub:**

   * Click "Open" -> "Add project from disk".
   * Navigate to the folder you just cloned.
3. **Configure API Key (Important Step):**

   * Inside the `Assets` folder in Unity, find the file named `GeminiKey.template.json`.
   * Make a copy of this file in the same folder.
   * Rename the copy to **`GeminiKey.json`**.
   * Open `GeminiKey.json` and replace the placeholder `"REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"` with your valid Gemini API Key.
4. **Assign the Key File in Unity:**

   * Select the GameObject with the `UnityAndGeminiV3` script in the Hierarchy (usually named `GameManager` or similar).
   * In the Inspector, find the `Unity And Gemini V3` component.
   * Drag the **`GeminiKey.json`** file from the `Assets` folder into the `Gemini Key Json File` field.
5. **Open the Main Scene:**

   * In the Project window, find the main scene (e.g., `SampleScene`) and open it.
6. **Press the Play Button!**

## ðŸŽ® How to Use

* **Online Mode**: To use Gemini, select the `GameManager` object in the Hierarchy. In the Inspector, **uncheck** `Use Offline Development Mode`.
* **Offline Mode (Default)**: For development without using API quota, **ensure** `Use Offline Development Mode` is **checked**. The game will use local random data for personalities and interactions.
